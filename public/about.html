  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="../assets/images/me.jpeg" alt="An image of myself. Click to know more about me." />
  <p>I'm not someone to be messed with. I may not look the role but I am a Person of Interest; and if you are a Person of Interest to me, then you better watch out; coz there are only 2 kinds of people who are of interest to me.</p>

  <p>The first is if you are a perpetrator; if you are planning on bringing harm then I will know about it and stop you before you do.</p>

  <p>The second is if you are victim. Not to worry though, if you are a victim and some harm is going to befall you, I shall immediately contact my friend John and he'll be there to save you.</p>
